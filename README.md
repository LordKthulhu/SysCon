# SysCon - A short course on nonlinear equation System solving for Constitutive modelling

This short course aims at giving basics to nonlinear equations and nonlinear systems in the context of constitutive modelling for solid mechanics, as well as training to implement classical methods like Newton-Raphson.\
It is written in `python` on `jupyter` notebooks. I recommend that you use `jupyter lab` for the best experience (you may need to `pip install jupyterlab`). You will also need `numpy` and `matplotlib`.\
The first folder `Lessons` contains the notebooks with holes in the code for you to fill from commented hints, while `Solutions` have the complete working notebooks with answers.
